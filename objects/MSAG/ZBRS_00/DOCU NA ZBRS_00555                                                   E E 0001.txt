AS During a background processing request, a program was specified which   
   cannot be scheduled. Programs which can be scheduled are particularly   
   distinguished by a defined starting point (for example, the classical   
   ABAP/4 programs or predefined model jobs). Programs which cannot be     
   csheduled are, for example, module pools or function pools.

AS The background processing request cannot be successfully completed with 
   the entered program name. The system displays the scheduling screen on  
   which the field for entering the program name is ready for input, so    
   that corrections can be made here.

AS There are two options for eliminating this problem situation:           
N1 Correct the program name, so that a program which can be scheduled      
   (that is a program with a defined starting point) is referenced by the  
   improved name.                                                          
N1 Correct the attributes of the originally entered program. This option   
   is recommended if the attributes of the program to be scheduled clearly 
   have incorrect values. Correct the attributes using the program editor.
