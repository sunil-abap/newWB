AS The function code field (OK code field) has not been defined on this    
   screen. If the user selects an application function (not a system       
   function), the system usually provides it in the function code field    
   (OK code field) as well as in SY-UCOMM. This is no longer possible.

AS The system is unable to inform the application of the current function  
   code. The application should not use field SY_COMM. This field always   
   contains the code of the last function chosen, which is not always      
   identical to the application-relevant code.

AS You should always define a field for the function code on every screen. 
   The Screen Painter always proposes such a field (OK category), you only 
   need to assign a name and include the definition in the ABAP program.
