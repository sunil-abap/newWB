AS One or more failed attempts made to log on to the system with a password
   and your user name. Failed logon attempts could be caused by you (typo  
   when entering hidden password) or could be an indication of an attempt  
   by a third party to guess your password.

AS Every failed attempt to log on with a password is counted. When a       
   preconfigurable threshold value is exceeded, any further password logon 
   attempts are blocked to keep your password from being guessed.          
AS This counter is reset after a successful <ZH>password logon</>. This    
   message tells you the value before the deletion.                        
AS If you log on to the system in another way (with Single Sign-On, not    
   with a password), the value of the counter remains unchanged. The number
   of failed password logon attempts is displayed again at the next logon.

AS If you suspect that other people are attempting to guess your password, 
   you should contact your system administrator. The system administrator  
   can then log any logon attempts where additional information (time      
   stamp, network address, and so on) is recorded which could help to      
   determine the cause.                                                    
AS If you are also able to <ZH>log on to the system without a password </> 
   (using Single Sign-On), you should consider deactivating the password   
   that is no longer required. Neither you nor other people can log on to  
   the system using your user name and the deactivated password, further   
   password logon attempts are denied. If it is not possible to log on to  
   the system by password, this is no longer displayed to you in a warning 
   message (about any failed password logon attempts).

AS Use the Security Audit Log to log both failed and successful logon      
   attempts.
