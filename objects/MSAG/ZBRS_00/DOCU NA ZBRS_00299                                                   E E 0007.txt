AS When the batch input folder &V1& was released, the system searched for  
   the corresponding background jobs. While doing so, it found an          
   associated job whose status was not yet set to "Complete".              
AS After this folder is released, it may be processed in a dialog or in    
   the background. If it is, this existing job may be executed, which      
   means that duplicate data may be posted.
