AS The input field contains prohibited character formats. In general,      
   these are character formats that your frontend may be able to process.  
   However, they are not allowed in the R/3 database.                      
AS There can be several reasons for this:                                  
/  ISO, Microsoft, IBM, Apple and so on often have a similar number of     
   character formats for a particular language set, but rarely the same    
   number. You can often enter and display more character formats than     
   there are included in the ISO character sets.                           
AS If you are using a frontend that is installed for a different language  
   set than the R/3 system which you have logged onto, then there are      
   several character formats on your keyboard that you cannot use.

AS The R/3 System replaces the prohibited character formats with other,    
   permitted character formats and outputs this error message (00.777).    
   The system places the cursor in the line or the field where the         
   prohibited character format is located.

AS If you agree with the proposal, re-select the last function key used    
   this is often [Enter]).                                                 
AS If you do not agree with the proposal, change the data. Only use        
   permitted character formats, otherwise you will receive the same error  
   message again.                                                          
AS If the required texts cannot be displayed with the character formats    
   permitted on your front-end, terminate the current transaction as       
   appropriate (by choosing the [Escape] key or [F12]).                    
/  There may be another front-end that can process the character formats   
   required.
