AS Up to Release 4.6B, batch input logs are stored in common log files. As 
   of Release 46C, these logs are stored in TemSe files. This change       
   provides the advantage that if one file is corrupt, all the other logs  
   on the application server are not lost.

AS You use report RSBDCLCH to convert (system-wide) all common log logs to 
   TemSe file logs. Note, the reverse is not possible. Use transaction     
   RZ11 to set profile parameter "bdc/new_protocol" to "on".

AS Logs created using the new interface cannot be read using the old       
   interface and vice versa. They do not appear in the list of existing    
   logs.
