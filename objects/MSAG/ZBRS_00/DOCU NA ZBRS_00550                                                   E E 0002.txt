AS The system outputs this message at the start of every job step and is   
   therefore usually located in a job log.                                 
AS This message means that step &V1& is currently being started. The       
   additional parameters give further details on the step itself:          
AS - the ABAp program executed in this step (here &V2&)                    
AS - the corresponding parameter (here &V3&)                               
AS   If this field is empty, then program &V2& does not need any           
   parameters.                                                             
AS - the name of the user with whose authorization program   &V2& is
