AS The input field contains prohibited characters. These are generally     
   characters that your frontend can process, but which are not permitted  
   in the R/3 database.                                                    
AS There can be several reasons for this:                                  
/  For any language area, the number of characters allowed by ISO,         
   Microsoft, IBM, Apple etc. is often similar but rarely exactly the      
   same. Frontends can often specify and display special characters in     
   addition to those contained in the ISO character sets.                  
AS If you are working on a frontend whose language area is not suitable    
   for the R/3 System onto which you have logged on, there are several     
   characters on your keyboard which cannot be used.

AS The R/3 System replaces these prohibited characters with other          
   permitted characters and displays this error message (00.195 or         
   00.077). The system positions the cursor in the line or field in which  
   the prohibited character was found.

AS If you agree with the proposal, you should re-choose the last function  
   key (often [Enter].)                                                    
AS If you do not agree with the proposal, you should edit the data. In     
   doing so only use permitted characters or the system will display the   
   error message again.                                                    
AS If you cannot display texts containing characters that are permitted by 
   your frontend, you should end the current transaction at a suitable     
   point (usually using the [Esc] key or [F12].)                           
/  There may be another frontend that is able to process these characters.
