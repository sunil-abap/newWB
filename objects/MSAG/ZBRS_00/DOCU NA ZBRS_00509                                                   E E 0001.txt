AS No job log could be found for the selected background job. If the       
   background job has the status 'terminated', this message indicates      
   problems starting the background job.

AS The problems which occur when starting a background job (for example,   
   the log cannot be created because of a capacity bottleneck), are        
   recorded in the system log.

AS For more precise analysis of the absence of a job log, check the system 
   log of the application server, which ran the background job. Messages   
   from background work processes are of particular interest here. These   
   messages indicate when a job started and any problems that occurred     
   during the start.
