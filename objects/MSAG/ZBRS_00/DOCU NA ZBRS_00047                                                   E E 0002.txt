AS The timestamps of the tables used in the screen were checked when       
   loading screen &V1& &V2&. At least one timestamp was not correct. The   
   screen was therefore regenerated and the timestamps of the tables used  
   were copied from the Data Dictionary.                                   
AS After generation, the timestamps were rechecked. Discrepancies in the   
   timestamps were still found.                                            
AS This occurs if the table in the Data Dictionary is modified or          
   activated during generation.
