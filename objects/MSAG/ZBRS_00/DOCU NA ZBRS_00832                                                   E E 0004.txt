   stored in TemSe files and can be read from there.

AS Use transaction RZ11 to determine whether profile parameter             
   'bdc/new_protocol' is set to 'on'.                                      
AS Use transaction SP11 to determine whether there are TemSe objects named 
   BDCLG*.

AS If you find logs using transaction SM35P, but do not find any TemSe     
   objects named BDCLG*, this means you are using the old process. Use     
   report RSBDCLCH to convert the session logs from 'common log' to TemSe  
   file.
