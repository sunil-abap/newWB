AS Communication from another system (R/3 System or other system) using    
   Secure Network Communications (SNC) was encountered. The SNC name (name 
   for the external security system) of the R/3 partner system is not in   
   the table SNCSYSACL for the target system or not permitted for the      
   corresponding communication mode (RFC/CPIC/DIAG).                       
AS

AS The table SNCSYSACL is an Access Control List (ACL) containing a list   
   of valid partner systems for SNC protected communication.               
AS If communication was terminated by a valid system, add an entry to the  
   table SNCSYSACL or activate the relevant communication mode.
