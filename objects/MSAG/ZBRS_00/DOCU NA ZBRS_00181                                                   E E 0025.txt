AS The two strings are made to overlap as much as possible (by searching   
   for the longest common string and rotating as necessary). The number of 
   different characters (after comparing character-by-character) returns   
   the number the system needs.                                            
AS For example:,,Old password:,,"BDAFAG",,(6 characters)                   
/  ,,,,New password:,,"ABC DBA",,(7 characters)                            
/  ,,,,After rotation:,,"DBAABC ",,(7 characters)                          
/  ,,,,==> Number of different characters = 4
