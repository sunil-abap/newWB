AS Deleting icons causes problems.                                         
AS The system cannot display a where-used list for icons. Deleting icons   
   may cause the programs or transactions used by the icons to be deleted  
   to function incorrectly.                                                
AS The strictly ascending order of icons can be broken, but you cannot     
   save the deletion. If you fill in the gaps created by deleting icons    
   with different icons, the system alsways displays these other icons     
   instead of the deleted icons. This may be unsuitable.

AS Only delete icons if this is absolutely necessary and if you are sure   
B1 that the icon is not yet used or                                        
B1 that you are filling the gap that appears with an icon with the same    
   meaning.
