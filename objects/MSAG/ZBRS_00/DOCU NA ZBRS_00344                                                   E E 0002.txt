U1 &CAUSE&                                                                 
AS The transaction sent a screen that was not expected in the batch input  
   session and which therefore could not be supplied with data.            
AS Possible reasons:                                                       
AS 1. The batch input session was created incorrectly. The sequence of     
   screens was recordly incorrectly.                                       
AS 2. The transaction behaves differently in background processing in a    
   batch work process than when running in dialog (SY-BATCH is queried and 
   changes the screen sequence).                                           
AS 3. The transaction has undergone user-specific Customizing and          
   therefore certain screens may be skipped or processed differently,      
   according to the current user. If the person who created a batch input  
   session is not the same as the person now processing it, this problem   
   may occur frequently.

AS None.

AS For 1: Either re-create the session or process it in expert mode.       
   Correct the batch input program.                                        
AS For 2. It is very difficult to analyze this problem, particularly in    
   the case that the screen sequence or the display-only options of fields 
   differ according to whether the transaction is being processed in the   
   background or as an online dialog. It could also be that this kind of   
   transaction cannot run with batch input.                                
AS For 3: Have the creator of the session process it. If no error occurs   
   now, then this is a program with user-specific Customizing.
