AS In a group of selection fields, exactly one field must be set (have the 
   value 'X').                                                             
AS If no selection field is set, the system sets the first field in the    
   group by default.

AS is set (this field contains the focus at the time of error), where      
   there is already a field set in the same group of selection fields. The 
   program error is corrected by ensuring that always exactly one field is 
   set in a selection field group.
