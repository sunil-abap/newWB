AS The selected job is already processed (for example, released or         
   deleted). In order that a work sequence once started can be             
   consistently carried out and completed, the selected job is locked by   
   the SAP locking mechanism. After a job is locked, only selected actions 
   (for example, display of job information) can be carried out. The lock  
   is released again upon completion of the activities.

AS The time between the start and the end of an action is generally only   
   short, so that a repeated attempt of the required action encounters a   
   job which is no longer locked, and the planned activities can therefore 
   be executed.                                                            
AS If the lock is still set even after repeated attempts, proceed as       
   follows:                                                                
N1 'Use transaction SM12 (display locks) to look at the locks that are set 
   for table TBTCO (also table TBTCS for deletion of released jobs) and    
   find out which user is currently locking the required job.              
N1 Ask this user to end the action that he or she has started.
