U1 &CAUSE&                                                                 
AS The memory area of the basis software for the GUI status is too small   
   for the requested status.  The following is stored in this area:        
B1 Administration information in fixed length                              
B1 Menu structure, F keys and push buttons of a status                     
B1 The texts of the complete interface (not just of the status)            
B1 The active and the requested Excluding list (<NP>SET PF-STATUS...       
   EXCLUDING ...</>).                                                      
U1 &SYSTEM_RESPONSE&                                                       
AS Termination as presumably the system is unable to continue processing.  
U1 &WHAT_TO_DO&                                                            
AS A short-term solution might consist of leaving off the <NP>EXCLUDING</> 
   for the current <NP>SET PF-STATUS...                                    
AS Clear up the interface affected: in the Menu Painter (Transaction       
   SE41), choose <LS>Utilities</> -> <LS>Unused objects</>.                
AS If it is an interface with a large number of statuses, it may be        
   possible to take the interface apart. This is often possible for        
   interfaces belonging to a function group that supplies GUI statuses for 
   multiple programs (these programs call up function modules of the group 
   that mainly contain a <NP>SET PF-STATUS</> command).                    
AS If the above solutions will not work, your system administrator will    
   have to enlarge the profile parameter "ztta/cua_area". Note that        
   profile parameter "ztta/short_area" must be at least 6 times as large   
   as "ztta/cua_area".
