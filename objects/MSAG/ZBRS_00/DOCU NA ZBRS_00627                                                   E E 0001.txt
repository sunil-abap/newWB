AS Before the start of the reorganization program, the system established  
   that a server is processing batch input sessions. The system            
   established a lock entry at BTCREORG.

AS Use Transaction SM12 to check whether the lock entry should exist at    
   all. If the server specified in the lock entry is not processing any    
   batch input sessions, you can delete the lock entry. You should then    
   restart the reorganization program.
