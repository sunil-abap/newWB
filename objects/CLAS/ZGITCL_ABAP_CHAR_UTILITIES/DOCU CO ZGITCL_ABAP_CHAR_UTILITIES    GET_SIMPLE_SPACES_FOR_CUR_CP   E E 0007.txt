U1 &FUNCTIONALITY&                                                         
AS This method returns a string, which contains the space characters (for  
   example SPACE, HORIZONTAL_TAB, and NEWLINE) most commonly used in the   
   current codepage.                                                       
LZ                                                                         
U1 &PRECONDITION&                                                          
AS                                                                         
U1 &RESULT&                                                                
AS The returned string refers to the current codepage of the application   
   server. Therefore, after executing <AB>SET LOCALE LANGUAGE my_langu</>, 
   you must call this method again. If in doubt, you should call this      
   method before every use. (For performance reasons, the result string is 
   buffered in the method.)                                                
AS If the current codepage is a multibyte codepage (for example Japanese), 
   then the result string also contains the multi-byte format of the       
   <ZK>full-width ideographic space</>.                                    
AS You can use the returned string as an operand for ABAP operators such   
   as <AB>CA</> or <AB>CO</>. With this you can ascertain whether, and if  
   so at what position, a field contains spaces. (The operators <AB>CA     
=  </>, <AB>CO</>, <AB>NA</>, and <AB>CN</> also support multibyte         
   characters.)                                                            
LZ

AS                                                                         
U1 &EXCEPTIONS&                                                            
AS

AS There are some less commonly used space characters that are not         
   returned by this method.
