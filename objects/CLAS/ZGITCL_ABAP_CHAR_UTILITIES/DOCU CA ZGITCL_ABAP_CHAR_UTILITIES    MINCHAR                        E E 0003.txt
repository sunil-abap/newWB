AS You can use MINCHAR and MAXCHAR in binary comparisons (SORT statement   
   without AS TEXT addition; IF with operators <, >, <=, >=; BETWEEN;      
=  comparison with a selection criterion IF f IN sel). CLEAR f WITH MINCHAR
   fills f with a value that is smaller than or equal to all character     
   sets.                                                                   
*  However, binary comparisons often do not meet the user's expectations;  
   for example, ISO-8859-1 has the character set 1 < A < Z < a <Ä < ü      
   while EBCDIC (SAP character set 0120) has  Ä < a < A < ü < Z < 1.       
*

AS MINCHAR is generally not a valid character of the current character     
AS set. In particular, you must not use TRANSLATE f TO UPPER CASE on       
   MAXCHAR. The same applies to operations that implicitly convert to      
   upper case, such as SEARCH, CS, NS, CP, or NP. You must not use         
   character set conversions on MAXCHAR.                                   
*  It is not guaranteed that MINCHAR is displayed as # on screens. In some 
   cases the system treats MINCHAR as the end of a text field.
