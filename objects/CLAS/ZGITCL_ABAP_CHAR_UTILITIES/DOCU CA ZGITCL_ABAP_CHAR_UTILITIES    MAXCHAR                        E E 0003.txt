AS You can use MINCHAR and MAXCHAR in binary comparisons (SORT statement   
   without AS TEXT addition; IF with operators <, >, <=, >=; BETWEEN;      
   comparison with a selection criterion IF f IN sel). CLEAR f WITH        
   MAXCHAR fills f with a value that is larger than or equal to all        
   character sets.                                                         
*  However, binary comparisons often do not meet the user's expectations;  
   for example, ISO-8859-1 has the character set 1 < A < Z < a <Ä < ü      
   while EBCDIC (SAP character set 0120) has  Ä < a < A < ü < Z < 1.

AS MAXCHAR is generally not a valid character of the current character     
   set. In particular, you must not use TRANSLATE f TO UPPER CASE on       
   MAXCHAR. The same applies to operations that implicitly convert to      
   upper case, such as SEARCH, CS, NS, CP, or NP. You must not not use     
   character set conversions on MAXCHAR.
