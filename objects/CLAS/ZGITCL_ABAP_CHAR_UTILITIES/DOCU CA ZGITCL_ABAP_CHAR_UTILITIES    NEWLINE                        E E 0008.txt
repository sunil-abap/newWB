AS This character serves as an end of line character in the system         
   character set.                                                          
*  If you use the TRANSFER statement to write this character to a file     
   opened in TEXT MODE, the system, in Microsoft Windows, automatically    
   writes a CR/LF pair (Carriage Return/Line Feed) into the file; for      
   further details refer to the keyword documentation for OPEN DATASET.    
*
